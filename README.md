# IBM-Data-Science-Professional Certificate-Capstone-Project
In this capstone, we will **predict** if the **Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully**. **SpaceX** advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.
This repo covers the following in my project workflow:
- Data Collection (API calls, web scrapping)
- Data Wrangling (Assessing, Cleaning Data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas, matplotlib etc
- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Model Deployment with IBM Watson Studio

# Dynamic Web App
I also developed a dynamic web app with django, react, and carbon design system that would help you explore the machine learning model, input different values to variables and predict whether SpaceX Falcon9 first stage will land or not.
